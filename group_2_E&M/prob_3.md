Of course. Here is an advanced problem in Electromagnetism that sits at the intersection of classical field theory and special relativity, perfect for a strong undergraduate or master's level student. It deals with the fundamental nature of the fields generated by a moving point charge.

### **Problem: The Fields of a Relativistically Moving Point Charge**

Consider a point charge $q$ moving with a **constant velocity** $\vec{v} = v \hat{z}$, where $v$ is a significant fraction of the speed of light $c$. At time $t=0$, the charge is at the origin of the lab frame $S$.

1.  **Potentials in the Lab Frame:**
    *   Write down the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials** $\phi(\vec{r}, t)$ and $\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t)$ for this charge. Simplify them significantly by using the constant velocity condition.
    *   Show that these potentials can be written in a form that looks exactly like the potentials of a charge at rest in a different frame. Find the **Lorentz transformation** that connects the lab frame $S$ to this rest frame $S'$.

2.  **Electric and Magnetic Fields:**
    *   Derive the **electric field** $\vec{E}(\vec{r}, t)$ and **magnetic field** $\vec{B}(\vec{r}, t)$ in the lab frame $S$ from these potentials.
    *   Your final expression for $\vec{E}$ should be:
        $$\vec{E}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{1 - \beta^2}{(1 - \beta^2 \sin^2 \theta)^{3/2}} \frac{\hat{\mathcal{R}}}{\mathcal{R}^2}$$
        where $\beta = v/c$, $\vec{\mathcal{R}} = \vec{r} - \vec{v}t$ is the vector from the *present* position of the charge to the observation point, and $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{\mathcal{R}}$ and $\vec{v}$. Justify this interpretation of $\vec{\mathcal{R}}$.
    *   Show that the magnetic field is related to the electric field by $\vec{B} = \frac{1}{c^2}(\vec{v} \times \vec{E})$.

3.  **Field Line Analysis:**
    *   Compare the electric field of the moving charge to that of a charge at rest. Describe how the field is "compressed" in the transverse direction. What is the "opening angle" $\theta_{max}$ of the cone inside which the field strength is largely concentrated? What happens to this angle as $v \to c$?
    *   Plot the electric field lines for a charge at rest and for a charge with $\beta = 0.95$. Describe the key difference.

4.  **Radiation Question:**
    *   A charged particle must be *accelerating* to radiate electromagnetic energy. Confirm this by calculating the Poynting vector $\vec{S} = \frac{1}{\mu_0}(\vec{E} \times \vec{B})$ far from the charge and showing that the *net power* passing through a large sphere surrounding the charge is **zero**. (This is a subtle but crucial point).

5.  **Advanced Challenge: The "Precursor" Wavefront**
    *   The Liénard-Wiechert potentials show that the electromagnetic field at point $( \vec{r}, t )$ is determined by the particle's **retarded position** and time.
    *   Consider an observer at a point $\vec{r}$ perpendicular to the path of the charge ($\theta = 90^\circ$). Calculate the exact time $t$ at which the field of the charge first arrives at this observer, as a function of the impact parameter $b$ (the perpendicular distance from the observer to the charge's path). Discuss the physical meaning of this result.

### **Solution Outline & Key Insights**

#### **1. Potentials and Lorentz Transformation**
*   The Liénard-Wiechert scalar potential is $\phi(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q c}{(c \mathcal{R} - \vec{\mathcal{R}} \cdot \vec{v})}$, where $\mathcal{R}$ is the distance to the retarded position. For constant velocity, the retarded position can be solved for analytically. The result simplifies to:
    $$\phi(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{\mathcal{R} \sqrt{1 - \beta^2 \sin^2 \theta}}$$
    $$\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{q \vec{v}}{\mathcal{R} \sqrt{1 - \beta^2 \sin^2 \theta}} = \frac{\vec{v}}{c^2} \phi(\vec{r}, t)$$
*   These are exactly the potentials you would get by taking the potentials in the rest frame ($\phi' = \frac{q}{4\pi \epsilon_0 r'}$, $\vec{A}'=0$) and performing a Lorentz boost with velocity $\vec{v}$. This is the easiest way to derive them.

#### **2. Deriving the Fields**
*   The fields are found by taking the gradients of the potentials: $\vec{E} = -\nabla \phi - \frac{\partial \vec{A}}{\partial t}$ and $\vec{B} = \nabla \times \vec{A}$. This calculation is non-trivial. The key is to express everything in terms of the present position vector $\vec{\mathcal{R}} = \vec{r} - \vec{v}t$.
*   The final expression for $\vec{E}$ shows it is still radial from the *present* position of the charge, but it is no longer spherically symmetric. It is stronger perpendicular to the motion ($\theta = 90^\circ$) and weaker parallel to it ($\theta = 0^\circ$ or $180^\circ$) by a factor of $(1-\beta^2)^{-1} = \gamma^2$.

#### **3. Field Line Analysis**
*   The field is "squished" into a pancake perpendicular to the direction of motion. The factor $(1 - \beta^2 \sin^2 \theta)^{3/2}$ in the denominator dictates this.
*   The opening angle $\theta_{max}$ is found by finding where the field strength is half its maximum value. As $v \to c$ ($\beta \to 1$), $\theta_{max} \to 0$, meaning the entire field is compressed into an infinitesimally thin disk perpendicular to the motion. This is a crucial result for understanding the radiation from ultra-relativistic particles in synchrotrons.

#### **4. The Poynting Vector and Radiation**
*   Calculating $\vec{S} \propto \vec{E} \times \vec{B} \propto \vec{E} \times (\vec{v} \times \vec{E}) = v E^2 \hat{\vec{v}} - (\vec{E} \cdot \vec{v}) \vec{E}$.
*   While this is non-zero locally (there is energy flow in the electromagnetic field), its angular distribution is such that when integrated over a sphere surrounding the charge, the *net* power flowing out is zero: $P = \oint \vec{S} \cdot d\vec{a} = 0$. This confirms that a uniformly moving charge does not radiate, resolving a classic paradox.

#### **5. The Precursor Wavefront**
*   For an observer at the point $(x=b, y=0, z=0)$ at time $t$, the retarded time $t_r$ is defined by $c^2(t-t_r)^2 = b^2 + v^2 t_r^2$.
*   The field arrives when a real solution for $t_r$ first exists. Solving this quadratic equation, the arrival time in the lab frame is $t = \frac{b}{c} \sqrt{1 - \beta^2}$. This is *before* the time $t = b/v$ that it would take for a particle moving at $v < c$ to reach the point of closest approach. This is a purely relativistic effect due to the finite speed of the interaction (the speed of light) and is a fascinating consequence of relativity.

This problem forces a deep understanding of how special relativity is woven into the fabric of classical electromagnetism. It's a cornerstone of advanced classical physics.
