### **Solution: Spherical Pendulum with Offset Spring**

---

#### **1. Lagrangian**

Let the pivot be at the origin \( O = (0,0,0) \), with the \( z \)-axis pointing upward (so gravity is \( \vec{g} = -g\hat{z} \)). The bob's position is given in spherical coordinates:
\[
\mathbf{r}_m = \ell (\sin\theta\cos\phi, \sin\theta\sin\phi, \cos\theta).
\]
The spring is anchored at \( O' = (0,0,-a) \), has stiffness \( k \), and natural length \( \ell_0 \). The spring length is:
\[
s(\theta) = \|\mathbf{r}_m - \mathbf{r}_{O'}\| = \sqrt{\ell^2 + a^2 + 2a\ell\cos\theta}.
\]
The kinetic and potential energies are:
\[
T = \frac{1}{2} m \ell^2 (\dot{\theta}^2 + \sin^2\theta \, \dot{\phi}^2), \quad U_g = mg\ell \cos\theta, \quad U_s = \frac{1}{2} k (s(\theta) - \ell_0)^2.
\]
Thus, the Lagrangian is:
\[
\boxed{L = \frac{1}{2} m \ell^2 (\dot{\theta}^2 + \sin^2\theta \, \dot{\phi}^2) - mg\ell \cos\theta - \frac{1}{2} k (s(\theta) - \ell_0)^2}.
\]

---

#### **2. Equations of Motion (Euler–Lagrange)**

**Generalized Momenta:**
\[
p_\theta = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = m \ell^2 \dot{\theta}, \quad p_\phi = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\phi}} = m \ell^2 \sin^2\theta \, \dot{\phi}.
\]

**\( \phi \)-equation (Axial Symmetry):**
Since \( \phi \) is cyclic, \( p_\phi \) is conserved:
\[
\frac{d}{dt} (m \ell^2 \sin^2\theta \, \dot{\phi}) = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \boxed{L_z = m \ell^2 \sin^2\theta \, \dot{\phi} = \text{constant}}.
\]

**\( \theta \)-equation:**
Compute derivatives:
\[
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} \right) = m \ell^2 \ddot{\theta}, \quad \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = m \ell^2 \sin\theta \cos\theta \, \dot{\phi}^2 - \frac{\partial U}{\partial \theta}.
\]
The potential derivative is:
\[
\frac{\partial U}{\partial \theta} = \frac{\partial U_g}{\partial \theta} + \frac{\partial U_s}{\partial \theta} = mg\ell \sin\theta + k (s - \ell_0) \frac{\partial s}{\partial \theta}.
\]
Using:
\[
\frac{\partial s}{\partial \theta} = -\frac{a\ell \sin\theta}{s},
\]
we get:
\[
\frac{\partial U}{\partial \theta} = mg\ell \sin\theta - k (s - \ell_0) \frac{a\ell \sin\theta}{s}.
\]
Substitute into the Euler–Lagrange equation:
\[
m \ell^2 \ddot{\theta} - m \ell^2 \sin\theta \cos\theta \, \dot{\phi}^2 + \frac{\partial U}{\partial \theta} = 0,
\]
yielding:
\[
\boxed{m \ell^2 \ddot{\theta} = m \ell^2 \sin\theta \cos\theta \, \dot{\phi}^2 - mg\ell \sin\theta + k \frac{a\ell}{s} (s - \ell_0) \sin\theta}.
\]

---

#### **3. Momenta and Energy (Hamiltonian)**

**Momenta:**
\[
\boxed{p_\theta = m \ell^2 \dot{\theta}, \quad p_\phi = m \ell^2 \sin^2\theta \, \dot{\phi}}.
\]

**Hamiltonian (Conserved Energy):**
\[
H = p_\theta \dot{\theta} + p_\phi \dot{\phi} - L = T + U,
\]
\[
\boxed{H = \frac{1}{2} m \ell^2 (\dot{\theta}^2 + \sin^2\theta \, \dot{\phi}^2) + mg\ell \cos\theta + \frac{1}{2} k (s(\theta) - \ell_0)^2}.
\]

---

### **4. Symmetries and Integrals of Motion**

The Lagrangian \( L \) exhibits two continuous symmetries, each yielding a conserved quantity via Noether's theorem:

- **Time Translation Invariance**:  
  Since \( L \) does not depend explicitly on time \( t \), the total energy \( H \) is conserved:
  \[
  \dot{H} = 0.
  \]

- **Axial Symmetry (Rotation about the \( z \)-axis)**:  
  The coordinate \( \phi \) is cyclic (\( \partial L / \partial \phi = 0 \)), so the conjugate momentum \( p_\phi \) is conserved. This corresponds to the conservation of the \( z \)-component of angular momentum:
  \[
  L_z = m \ell^2 \sin^2\theta \, \dot{\phi} = \text{constant}, \quad \dot{L}_z = 0.
  \]

The full angular momentum vector \( \mathbf{L} \) is **not** conserved due to external torques:
- Gravity exerts a torque about horizontal axes.
- The spring anchor at \( (0, 0, -a) \) breaks spherical symmetry, inducing additional torques.

With two degrees of freedom \( (\theta, \phi) \) and two independent, involutive integrals of motion \( (H, L_z) \) (i.e., their Poisson bracket satisfies \( \{H, L_z\} = 0 \)), the system is **Liouville-integrable**. This implies:
- The equations of motion can be solved by quadratures (integration).
- The motion is regular and confined to invariant tori in phase space.
- The reduction to one degree of freedom (via the effective potential) is a direct consequence of integrability.

---

This formulation clearly identifies the symmetries, their associated conserved quantities, and the implications of integrability, providing a complete and structured explanation for Section 4.


### **5. 1D Reduction: Effective Potential and Turning Points**

The system is reduced to one degree of freedom by utilizing the conserved axial angular momentum \( L_z = m \ell^2 \sin^2 \theta \, \dot{\phi} \). The Hamiltonian becomes:
\[
H = \frac{p_\theta^2}{2m \ell^2} + U_{\text{eff}}(\theta; L_z),
\]
where the effective potential is:
\[
U_{\text{eff}}(\theta; L_z) = \frac{L_z^2}{2m \ell^2 \sin^2 \theta} + mg \ell \cos \theta + \frac{1}{2} k (s(\theta) - \ell_0)^2,
\]
with \( s(\theta) = \sqrt{\ell^2 + a^2 + 2a \ell \cos \theta} \).

#### **Turning Points**
For a fixed energy \( H \) and angular momentum \( L_z \), the motion in \( \theta \) is confined to the region where \( H \geq U_{\text{eff}}(\theta; L_z) \). The turning points occur when \( H = U_{\text{eff}}(\theta; L_z) \), which corresponds to \( \dot{\theta} = 0 \) (i.e., \( p_\theta = 0 \)). These points define the minimum and maximum values of \( \theta \) during the motion, denoted \( \theta_{\min} \) and \( \theta_{\max} \). They are found by solving the equation:
\[
H = \frac{L_z^2}{2m \ell^2 \sin^2 \theta} + mg \ell \cos \theta + \frac{1}{2} k (s(\theta) - \ell_0)^2.
\]
The number and position of turning points depend on the values of \( H \) and \( L_z \), and the shape of \( U_{\text{eff}} \). For bounded motion, there are typically two turning points, between which \( \theta \) oscillates.

#### **Classification of Motion**
- **Planar Motion (\( L_z = 0 \))**:  
  When \( L_z = 0 \), the angular velocity \( \dot{\phi} = 0 \) (from \( L_z = m \ell^2 \sin^2 \theta \, \dot{\phi} \)), so the motion is confined to a fixed vertical plane. The effective potential reduces to:
  \[
  U_{\text{eff}}(\theta; 0) = mg \ell \cos \theta + \frac{1}{2} k (s(\theta) - \ell_0)^2.
  \]
  The turning points are found from \( H = U_{\text{eff}}(\theta; 0) \), and \( \theta \) oscillates between these points without any azimuthal motion.

- **Nutational Motion (\( L_z \neq 0 \))**:  
  When \( L_z \neq 0 \), \( \dot{\phi} \neq 0 \), and the bob revolves around the \( z \)-axis. The centrifugal term \( \frac{L_z^2}{2m \ell^2 \sin^2 \theta} \) in \( U_{\text{eff}} \) diverges as \( \theta \to 0 \) or \( \theta \to \pi \), confining the motion away from the poles. The angle \( \theta \) oscillates between turning points \( \theta_{\min} \) and \( \theta_{\max} \), while \( \phi \) precesses monotonically. This results in a nutational motion, where the bob moves between two latitudes while rotating azimuthally.

The system is thus characterized by oscillatory motion in \( \theta \) and precessional motion in \( \phi \), with the nature determined by \( L_z \).



You are absolutely right to point that out. My previous answer explained the *concept* of turning points but did not provide an analytical solution for them. The reason for this is crucial and worth explaining clearly:

**For the general case of this system, it is impossible to solve for the turning points** \(\theta_{\text{turn}}\) **analytically (i.e., with a simple closed-form formula).**

Here is the detailed explanation of why, and what one would do instead:

### **Why an Analytical Solution is Impossible**

The turning points are defined by the equation:
\[
H = U_{\text{eff}}(\theta; L_z) = \frac{L_z^2}{2m \ell^2 \sin^2 \theta} + mg \ell \cos \theta + \frac{1}{2} k \left( \sqrt{\ell^2 + a^2 + 2a\ell \cos\theta} - \ell_0 \right)^2
\]

This equation is **transcendental** and highly nonlinear. It contains:
1.  A term with \(\frac{1}{\sin^2\theta}\) (from the centrifugal potential).
2.  A term with \(\cos\theta\) (from gravity).
3.  A term with a square root inside a squared expression (from the spring).

There is no algebraic manipulation (like substitution) that can reduce this equation to a standard form (like a polynomial) that can be solved for \(\theta\). This is a common situation in physics for all but the simplest systems (e.g., a simple harmonic oscillator or a pendulum without a spring).

### **How to Find Turning Points in Practice**

Since an analytic solution is not feasible, we use other methods to understand and find the turning points:

1.  **Graphical Analysis:** The most insightful method is to plot \( U_{\text{eff}}(\theta) \) for a fixed \(L_z\).
    *   On the same graph, draw a horizontal line at the value of the total energy \(H\).
    *   The points where this horizontal line intersects the curve of \(U_{\text{eff}}\) are the turning points \(\theta_{\text{turn}}\).
    *   This visually shows the number of turning points (e.g., two for bounded oscillatory motion) and their approximate locations.

    

2.  **Numerical Solution:** For precise values, we use root-finding algorithms on the equation:
    \[
    F(\theta) = U_{\text{eff}}(\theta; L_z) - H = 0
    \]
    Algorithms like the **bisection method** or **Newton-Raphson method** can quickly and accurately find the values of \(\theta\) that satisfy this equation for given parameters \(H, L_z, m, \ell, g, k, a, \ell_0\).

3.  **Special Cases:** Analytical solutions are only possible if we make simplifying assumptions that drastically reduce the complexity:
    *   **No Spring (\(k = 0\)):** The equation becomes \(H = \frac{L_z^2}{2m \ell^2 \sin^2 \theta} + mg \ell \cos\theta\). This is the standard spherical pendulum. It's still transcendental, but better studied.
    *   **No Rotation (\(L_z = 0\)):** The centrifugal term vanishes. The equation is \(H = mg \ell \cos\theta + \frac{1}{2} k (s(\theta) - \ell_0)^2\). This is still generally unsolvable analytically.
    *   **Small Oscillations:** We don't solve for the turning points directly. Instead, we approximate the effective potential as a harmonic oscillator near a minimum, which gives us the amplitude and frequency, but not the exact \(\theta\) values.

### **Summary**

To directly address your question: I did not provide an analytical solution for the turning points **because none exists** for the general parameters of this problem.

The standard and practical approach is to:
1.  Understand their physical meaning (the limits of the motion where kinetic energy is zero).
2.  Use the graphical method to visualize their behavior and how they change with energy \(H\).
3.  Use numerical methods to compute their precise values when needed.

This is a fundamental aspect of working with nonlinear physical systems: we often must move beyond analytic solutions and employ graphical and numerical techniques to gain insight.



### 🌀 Step 6: Small Oscillations About the Bottom

#### 🔁 Change of Variable and Expansion
We consider small oscillations around the stable equilibrium point where the pendulum hangs straight down. Let  
\[
\theta = \pi - \psi \quad \text{with} \quad \psi \ll 1.
\]  
Then,  
\[
\sin\theta = \sin(\pi - \psi) = \sin\psi \approx \psi, \quad \cos\theta = \cos(\pi - \psi) = -\cos\psi \approx -1 + \frac{\psi^2}{2}.
\]

#### 📐 Kinetic Energy Expansion
The kinetic energy is  
\[
T = \frac{1}{2} m \ell^2 (\dot{\theta}^2 + \sin^2\theta \, \dot{\phi}^2).
\]  
Since \(\dot{\theta} = -\dot{\psi}\), we have \(\dot{\theta}^2 = \dot{\psi}^2\), and \(\sin^2\theta \approx \psi^2\). Thus,  
\[
T \approx \frac{1}{2} m \ell^2 (\dot{\psi}^2 + \psi^2 \dot{\phi}^2).
\]  
For small oscillations about the bottom, the angular momentum \(L_z = m \ell^2 \sin^2\theta \, \dot{\phi}\) must be zero (otherwise, centrifugal forces would push the pendulum away from the vertical). Hence, \(\dot{\phi} = 0\), and the kinetic energy reduces to  
\[
T \approx \frac{1}{2} m \ell^2 \dot{\psi}^2.
\]

#### ⚖️ Potential Energy Expansion
The potential energy has two parts: gravitational and spring.

- **Gravitational Potential**:  
  \[
  U_g = mg\ell \cos\theta \approx mg\ell \left(-1 + \frac{\psi^2}{2}\right) = -mg\ell + \frac{1}{2} mg\ell \psi^2.
  \]

- **Spring Potential**:  
  The spring length is  
  \[
  s(\theta) = \sqrt{\ell^2 + a^2 + 2a\ell \cos\theta}.
  \]  
  Substituting \(\cos\theta \approx -1 + \frac{\psi^2}{2}\):  
  \[
  s(\theta) \approx \sqrt{(\ell - a)^2 + a\ell \psi^2}.
  \]  
  Let \(\Delta = |\ell - a|\). Then,  
  \[
  s(\theta) \approx \Delta \sqrt{1 + \frac{a\ell}{\Delta^2} \psi^2} \approx \Delta + \frac{a\ell}{2\Delta} \psi^2.
  \]  
  So,  
  \[
  s(\theta) - \ell_0 \approx (\Delta - \ell_0) + \frac{a\ell}{2\Delta} \psi^2.
  \]  
  The spring potential is  
  \[
  U_s = \frac{1}{2} k (s - \ell_0)^2 \approx \frac{1}{2} k (\Delta - \ell_0)^2 + \frac{1}{2} k \frac{a\ell}{\Delta} (\Delta - \ell_0) \psi^2.
  \]

- **Total Potential**:  
  Combining both parts and dropping constants:  
  \[
  U \approx \frac{1}{2} \left[ mg\ell + k \frac{a\ell}{\Delta} (\Delta - \ell_0) \right] \psi^2.
  \]

#### 🧮 Lagrangian and Equation of Motion
The Lagrangian to quadratic order is  
\[
L = T - U \approx \frac{1}{2} m \ell^2 \dot{\psi}^2 - \frac{1}{2} \left[ mg\ell + k \frac{a\ell}{\Delta} (\Delta - \ell_0) \right] \psi^2.
\]  
The equation of motion is  
\[
m \ell^2 \ddot{\psi} + \left[ mg\ell + k \frac{a\ell}{\Delta} (\Delta - \ell_0) \right] \psi = 0.
\]  
This is a harmonic oscillator equation with frequency  
\[
\omega_0^2 = \frac{1}{m \ell^2} \left[ mg\ell + k \frac{a\ell}{\Delta} (\Delta - \ell_0) \right] = \frac{g}{\ell} + \frac{k a}{m \ell} \frac{\Delta - \ell_0}{\Delta}.
\]  
Since \(\Delta = |\ell - a|\), we write  
\[
\boxed{\omega_0^2 = \frac{g}{\ell} + \frac{k a}{m \ell} \frac{|\ell - a| - \ell_0}{|\ell - a|}}.
\]

#### 🔄 Isotropy and No Linear Precession
The potential depends only on \(\psi^2\), which is the square of the distance from the vertical. This implies **isotropic** dynamics in the horizontal plane—the restoring force is the same in all directions. Consequently, small oscillations occur at the same frequency regardless of direction, and there is **no linear precession** (i.e., the plane of oscillation does not rotate at linear order).

#### ✅ Limiting Cases
- **No spring** (\(k = 0\)): \(\omega_0^2 = g/\ell\) (standard pendulum).
- **Spring attached at pivot** (\(a = 0\)): \(\omega_0^2 = g/\ell\) (spring irrelevant).
- **Spring at natural length at bottom** (\(\ell_0 = \Delta\)): \(\omega_0^2 = g/\ell\) (spring exerts no force).

This analysis confirms the expected behavior for small oscillations about the stable equilibrium.

---

This completes the derivation for Step 6. The small oscillation frequency is derived, and the isotropy of the motion is explained, showing no linear precession occurs.

---
### 🧭 Step 7: Relative Equilibria (Steady Conical Motion) & Stability

#### 🔧 Setup Recap
- The bob moves on a sphere of radius \(\ell\).
- Spring anchor at \(O' = (0, 0, -a)\), with spring constant \(k\) and natural length \(\ell_0\).
- Spring length: \(s(\theta) = \sqrt{\ell^2 + a^2 + 2a\ell \cos\theta}\).
- Conserved axial angular momentum: \(L_z = m\ell^2 \sin^2\theta \, \dot{\phi}\).
- Equation of motion for \(\theta\):
  \[
  m\ell^2 \ddot{\theta} = m\ell^2 \sin\theta \cos\theta \, \dot{\phi}^2 + mg\ell \sin\theta + k \frac{a\ell}{s} (s - \ell_0) \sin\theta.
  \]

---

#### 📍 (a) Existence of Conical Motion

A **relative equilibrium** occurs when the bob traces a cone at constant angle \(\theta = \theta_*\) with uniform azimuthal spin \(\dot{\phi} = \omega_*\). Set \(\ddot{\theta} = 0\), \(\dot{\theta} = 0\), and \(\theta = \theta_*\) in the equation of motion.

- **Axial case**: \(\sin\theta_* = 0\) (i.e., \(\theta_* = 0\) or \(\pi\)) — not conical.
- **Conical case**: \(\sin\theta_* \neq 0\). Divide the equation by \(\sin\theta_*\):
  \[
  m\ell^2 \cos\theta_* \, \omega_*^2 + mg\ell + k \frac{a\ell}{s_*} (s_* - \ell_0) = 0, \tag{1}
  \]
  where \(s_* = s(\theta_*) = \sqrt{\ell^2 + a^2 + 2a\ell \cos\theta_*}\).

Solve for \(\omega_*^2\):
\[
\omega_*^2 = -\frac{\displaystyle \frac{g}{\ell} + \frac{k a}{m\ell} \frac{s_* - \ell_0}{s_*}}{\cos\theta_*}. \tag{2}
\]

🔍 **Existence conditions**:
- **Bottom cones** (\(\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta_* \leq \pi\), \(\cos\theta_* < 0\)): Numerator must be positive.
- **Top cones** (\(0 \leq \theta_* < \frac{\pi}{2}\), \(\cos\theta_* > 0\)): Numerator must be negative (requires strong upward spring force).

In terms of \(L_z = m\ell^2 \sin^2\theta_* \, \omega_*\), equation (1) becomes:
\[
-\frac{L_z^2 \cos\theta_*}{m\ell^2 \sin^3\theta_*} - mg\ell \sin\theta_* - k \frac{a\ell}{s_*} (s_* - \ell_0) \sin\theta_* = 0. \tag{1'}
\]

---
 ### (b) stability and nutation motion 
In the context of analyzing the stability of steady conical motion (relative equilibria) and finding the nutation frequency, the linearized equation is derived by approximating the nonlinear equations of motion around the equilibrium point. This approach is standard because it simplifies the problem and provides analytical insights. However, it is also possible to consider the full nonlinear system, which involves solving the exact equations without approximation. Below, I explain both approaches and what "solving the full nonlinear system" entails.

### Linearized Approach (As Used in Item 7)
The linearized equation for nutation arises from considering small perturbations around the steady conical motion. Here's a step-by-step summary:
- **Steady state**: For a relative equilibrium, we have \(\theta(t) = \theta_*\) and \(\dot{\phi}(t) = \omega_*\), with \(\theta_*\) constant.
- **Perturbation**: Introduce a small deviation \(\eta(t)\) such that \(\theta(t) = \theta_* + \eta(t)\), with \(|\eta(t)| \ll 1\).
- **Effective potential**: The motion for \(\theta\) is governed by the effective potential \(U_{\text{eff}}(\theta)\) at fixed \(L_z\). The equation of motion is:
  \[
  m\ell^2 \ddot{\theta} = -U_{\text{eff}}'(\theta).
  \]
- **Taylor expansion**: Expand \(U_{\text{eff}}'(\theta)\) around \(\theta_*\):
  \[
  U_{\text{eff}}'(\theta) = U_{\text{eff}}'(\theta_*) + U_{\text{eff}}''(\theta_*) \eta + \mathcal{O}(\eta^2).
  \]
  Since \(U_{\text{eff}}'(\theta_*) = 0\) at equilibrium, this simplifies to:
  \[
  U_{\text{eff}}'(\theta) \approx U_{\text{eff}}''(\theta_*) \eta.
  \]
- **Linearized equation**: Substituting into the equation of motion gives:
  \[
  m\ell^2 \ddot{\eta} + U_{\text{eff}}''(\theta_*) \eta = 0.
  \]
  This is a harmonic oscillator equation, where the nutation frequency is:
  \[
  \omega_{\text{nut}}^2 = \frac{U_{\text{eff}}''(\theta_*)}{m\ell^2}.
  \]
- **Advantage**: This method is straightforward and provides an explicit formula for \(\omega_{\text{nut}}\) and a clear stability criterion (\(\omega_{\text{nut}}^2 > 0\) for stability).

### Solving the Full Nonlinear System
"Solving the full nonlinear system" means dealing with the original, unapproximated equations of motion. For the \(\theta\) equation, this is:
\[
m\ell^2 \ddot{\theta} = -U_{\text{eff}}'(\theta),
\]
where \(U_{\text{eff}}'(\theta)\) is a nonlinear function of \(\theta\) (due to the centrifugal, gravitational, and spring terms). This equation does not have a general analytical solution, so alternative methods are required:
- **Numerical integration**: Use numerical methods (e.g., Runge-Kutta) to solve for \(\theta(t)\) under specific initial conditions. From the solution, you could extract the nutation frequency by analyzing the period of oscillation or using Fourier transforms.
- **Qualitative analysis**: Study the phase portrait (\(\dot{\theta}\) vs. \(\theta\)) to understand the behavior without solving explicitly. This involves looking at level curves of the energy \(H\) in the phase plane.
- **Perturbation methods**: For larger amplitudes, use techniques like the method of multiple scales or averaging to find approximate solutions that capture nonlinear effects (e.g., amplitude-dependent frequency).
- **Hamiltonian formalism**: Express the system in action-angle variables, which can provide insights into the frequencies and resonances, but this is often complex.

**Why linearization is preferred here**:
- The linearized approach is sufficient for determining linear stability and the nutation frequency for small perturbations, which is the standard for such problems.
- Solving the full nonlinear system is more computationally intensive and does not yield a simple formula. It is typically reserved for cases where large amplitudes or nonlinear phenomena (e.g., chaos) are of interest.

### Example of Nonlinear Effect
For larger perturbations, the nutation frequency \(\omega_{\text{nut}}\) might depend on the amplitude of \(\eta\). In contrast, the linearized frequency is amplitude-independent. To capture this, you would need to solve the nonlinear system numerically or use advanced analytical methods.

In summary, the linearized equation provides a practical and efficient way to analyze stability and nutation frequency near equilibrium. Solving the full nonlinear system is more general but requires numerical or advanced analytical techniques. For the purposes of this problem, the linearized approach is appropriate and commonly used.

#### 🔎 (c) Special Cases and Interpretation

- **No spring** (\(k = 0\)):  
  From (2), \(\omega_*^2 = -\frac{g}{\ell \cos\theta_*}\).  
  Then (4) reduces to:
  \[
  \omega_{\text{nut}}^2 = \omega_*^2 (1 + 3\cos^2\theta_*) > 0.
  \]
  Classic stable spherical pendulum result.

- **Spring at pivot** (\(a = 0\)): Spring terms vanish → same as \(k = 0\).

- **No gravity** (\(g = 0\)):  
  From (2), \(\omega_*^2 = -\frac{k a}{m\ell} \frac{s_* - \ell_0}{s_* \cos\theta_*}\).  
  Stability depends on sign of \(\omega_{\text{nut}}^2\) from (4).

---

#### 🛠️ (d) Practical Use

1. **Choose parameters** \(m, \ell, k, \ell_0, a, g\).
2. **Pick a candidate** \(\theta_*\) (with \(\sin\theta_* \neq 0\)), compute \(s_*\).
3. **Check existence**: Use (2) to compute \(\omega_*^2\). Discard if \(\omega_*^2 < 0\).
4. **Test stability**: Plug \(\theta_*, \omega_*\) into (4). If \(\omega_{\text{nut}}^2 > 0\), the motion is stable.

📈 The spring modifies the balance and curvature of the effective potential, affecting both existence and stability of conical motions.

---

This completes the analysis for Item 7. The existence and stability of conical motions are determined by equations (2) and (4), respectively. Numerical evaluation may be needed for specific parameters.
