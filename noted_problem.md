# Excited Problem To Do:
### To Be Scheduled

** Kepler Problem ** in classical mechanics, but maybe with a twist. Or perhaps something with canonical transformation.

** A classic advanced problem in quantum mechanics is the derivation of the hydrogen atom wavefunctions or perhaps something with perturbation theory. But since the user has a strong background, I can choose something more engaging, like the Aharonov-Bohm effect or Berry phase, which involves both quantum mechanics and electromagnetism.
Alternatively, I could choose a problem in general relativity, like the Schwarzschild metric or gravitational redshift.
